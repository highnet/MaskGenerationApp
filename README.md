# Waterlab

Waterlab is a MATLAB-based toolkit for advanced image processing and analysis, focused on water body segmentation, distance transforms, and morphological operations. It provides a suite of tools and graphical interfaces for researchers and engineers working with satellite and aerial imagery of lakes and rivers.

## Core Technologies

- MATLAB (tested with R2021 and later)
- Image Processing Toolbox
- Custom algorithms for segmentation, region growing, and distance transforms
- Interactive MATLAB Apps (MLAPP)
